A final year computer science student at the University of Pretoria, South Africa.

Has been working for two years with Dr Nils Timm of the Department of Formal Methods at UP on implementations of research done by Dr Timm on the model checking of concurrent systems. 

The public Tvamucs repository shared here is an example of this work. Currently another research implementation is taking place in a private repository that will be made public in due time.
